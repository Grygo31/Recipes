        <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. scallions, minced</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
                <li>oil</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3 class="h3">Directions</h3>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl mix the cream cheese, scallions and garlic powder together.</li>
                <li>Preheat oil in a heavy bottomed pot, a couple inches high to 350 degrees.</li>
                <li>Put 1 tablespoon in a middle of a wonton wrapper and with your finger add water to the edges.</li>
                <li>Push the four centers of each side into the middle and press them together.</li>
                <li>Once the middle is connected from all four sides connect the little wings coming out from the middle.</li>
                <li>Let sit while you make all the wontons and when you start to fry, begin with the wontons you made first, they'll be the driest.</li>
                <li>You aren't cooking anything to a specific temperature for food safety reasons, so just cook until golden brown.</li>
            </ol>
